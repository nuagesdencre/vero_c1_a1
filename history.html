    <h3>A glimpse into the Chateau Frontenac's history</h3>
    <p> William Van Horne, the president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, built the hotel in the late 1800s in hope of
      attracting rich tourists who would then travel by train. While the hotel was renovated, built upon and suffered a
      few calamities (fires and tough winters), it still stands strong and picturesque today.</p>
    <h3>A fortress</h3>
    <p>The architecture of the Chateau Frontenac is inspired from French medieval castles with an emphasis on Gothic
      elements. It was designed in 1892 by architect Bruce Price and was first completed in 1893. Many expansions have
      been added since in a similar style.</p>
    <h3>The Chateau's Name</h3>
    <p>As an historical hat tip, the hotel was named after Louis de Buade, Count of Frontenac, who was the Governor
      General of New France in the late 1600s. This is particularly relevant as Quebec is one of the oldest known
      settlements in North America, a French-speaking city where a
      Samuel de Champlain founded a French settlement in 1608; the pride in the French origin of the colonies was
      indisputed.</p>
